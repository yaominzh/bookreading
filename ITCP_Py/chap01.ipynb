    "邱奇-图灵论题表明，如果一个函数是可计算的，那么一定可以通过对图灵机进行编程实现这种计算\n",

    "邱奇-图灵论题可以直接推导出图灵完备性这个概念。如果一门编程语言可以模拟通用图灵机，才可以说它是图灵完备的。所有现代编程语言都是图灵完备的。因此，任何可以被一门编程语言（例如Python）实现的程序，都可以被另一门编程语言（例如Java）实现。\n",
    "The Church-Turing thesis leads directly to the notion of Turing completeness. A programming language is said to be Turing complete if it can be used to simulate a universal Turing Machine. All modern programming languages are Turing complete. As a consequence, anything that can be programmed in one programming language (e.g., Python) can be programmed in any other programming language (e.g., Java). \n",

    "每种编程语言都有基本结构、语法、静态语义和语义。如果用一门自然语言类比，例如英语， 那么基本结构就是单词，语法则用来描述哪些单词放在一起可以组成通顺的句子，静态语义定义了哪些句子是有意义的，语义则定义了句子的实际含义。 Python语言中的基本结构包括字面量（例如，数值3.2和字符串'abc'）和中缀操作符（例如， +和/）。\n",
    "Each programming language has a set of primitive constructs, a syntax, a static semantics, and a semantics. By analogy with a natural language, e.g., English, the primitive constructs are words, the syntax describes which strings of words constitute well-formed sentences, the static semantics defines which sentences are meaningful, and the semantics defines the meaning of those sentences. The primitive constructs in Python include literals (e.g., the number 3.2 and the string 'abc') and infix operators (e.g., + and /)."
