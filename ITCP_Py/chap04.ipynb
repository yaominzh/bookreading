    "我们已经介绍了数值、赋值语句、输入/输出、比较语句和循环结构。它们在 Python中有多大用处呢？从理论上说，它们可以满足你的所有需求，也就是说，它是图灵完备的。 这意味着如果一个问题可以通过计算来解决，它就可以通过我们介绍过的那些语句来解决\n",
    "So far, we have introduced numbers, assignments, input/output, comparisons, and looping constructs. How powerful is this subset of Python? In a theoretical sense, it is as powerful as you will ever need, i.e., it is Turing complete. This means that if a problem can be solved via computation, it can be solved using only those statements you have already seen\n",

    "## 4.1 函数与作用域\n",
    "总结一下，当函数被调用时，会执行如下过程。\n",
    "To recapitulate, when a function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) 构成实参的表达式被求值，函数的形参被绑定到求值结果。\n",
    "The expressions that make up the actual parameters are evaluated, and the formal parameters of the function are bound to the resulting values.\n",
    "(2) 执行点（要执行的下一条指令）从调用点转到函数体的第一条语句\n",
    "The expressions that make up the actual parameters are evaluated, and the formal parameters of the function are bound to the resulting values.\n",
    "(3) 执行函数体中的代码，直至遇到return语句。这时， return后面的表达式的值就成为这 次函数调用的值；或者没有语句可以继续执行，这时函数返回的值为None；如果return后面没 有表达式，这次调用的值也为None。\n",
    "The code in the body of the function is executed until either a return statement is encountered, in which case the value of the expression following the return becomes the value of the function invocation, or there are no more statements to execute, in which case the function returns the value None. (If no expression follows the return, the value of the invocation is None.)\n",
    "(4) 这次函数调用的值就是返回值。\n",
    "The value of the invocation is the returned value\n",
    "(5) 执行点移动到紧跟在这次函数调用后面的代码。\n",
    "The point of execution is transferred back to the codeThe point of execution is transferred back to the code immediately following the invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "参数有一个特性，称为Lambda抽象。它允许程序员编写的代码所处理的不是具体对象，而 是函数调用者选定用作实参的任何对象。\n",
    "Parameters provide something called lambda abstraction, allowing programmers to write code that manipulates not specific objects, but instead whatever objects the caller of the function chooses to use as actual parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lambda抽象”这个名词来自阿隆佐·邱奇在20世纪三四十年代提出的一些数学理论。\n",
    "The name “lambda abstraction” is derived from mathematics developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s and 1940s\n",
    "\n",
    "对“作用域”可以进行如下理解。Here’s one way to think about this:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) 在最顶层，比如shell层，有一个符号表会跟踪记录这一层所有的名称定义和它们当前的 绑定。\n",
    "At top level, i.e., the level of the shell, a symbol table keeps track of all names defined at that level and their current bindings.\n",
    "(2) 调用函数时，会建立一个新的符号表（常称为栈帧）。这个表跟踪记录函数中所有的名称 定义（包括形参）和它们当前的绑定。如果函数体内又调用了一个函数，就再建立一个栈帧\n",
    "When a function is called, a new symbol table (often called a stack frame) is created. This table keeps track of all names defined within the function (including the formal parameters) and their current bindings. If a function is called from within the function body, yet another stack frame is created\n",
    "(3) 函数结束时，它的栈帧也随之消失。\n",
    "When the function completes, its stack frame goes\n",
    "away\n",
    "## 4.2 规范 Specifications\n",
    "函数的规范定义了函数编写者与使用者之间的约定。我们将函数使用者称为客户。可以认为\n",
    "约定包括以下两部分。\n",
    "A specification of a function defines a contract between the implementer of a function and those who will be writing programs that use the function. We will refer to the users of a function as its clients. This contract can be thought of as containing two parts:\n",
    "1. 假设 Assumptions\n",
    "2. 保证 Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "函数是一种创建基本程序元素的方式。我们非常乐于像内置函数一样使用求根函数和很多其 他复杂操作，就像使用内置函数max和abs一样。函数通过分解和抽象的功能，大大提高了编程的 便捷性。\n",
    "Functions are a way of creating computational elements that we can think of as primitives. Just as we have the builtin functions max and abs, we would like to have the equivalent of a built-in function for finding roots and for many other complex operations. Functions facilitate this by providing decomposition and abstraction\n",
    "分解实现了程序结构化。它允许我们将程序分成多个逻辑上独立的部分，并可以通过各种设 定实现重用。\n",
    "Decomposition creates structure. It allows us to break a program into parts that are reasonably self-contained, and that may be reused in different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "抽象隐藏了细节。它允许我们将一段代码当作黑箱使用。所谓黑箱，是指那些我们不能看见、 不需看见甚至根本不想看见内部细节的东西。 ①抽象的精髓在于，在具体背景之下，保留那些该 保留的，忽略那些该忽略的。在编程中有效使用抽象的关键在于，找到一个对于抽象创建者和抽 象潜在使用者都很合适的相关性表示。这才是真正的程序设计艺术。\n",
    "Abstraction hides detail. It allows us to use a piece of code as if it were a black box—that is, something whose interior details we cannot see, don’t need to see, and shouldn’t even want to see.26 The essence of abstraction is preserving information that is relevant in a given context, and forgetting information that is irrelevant in that context. The key to using abstraction effectively in programming is finding a notion of relevance that is appropriate for both the builder of an abstraction and the potential clients of the abstraction. That is the true art of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "抽象归根结底就是忽略\n",
    "Abstraction is all about forgetting.\n",

    "## 4.3 递归\n",
    "你可能听说过递归，也完全有可能认为这是一项高深的编程技术。它其实是计算机科学家广 为散布的一种具有迷惑性的都市传奇，目的是使人们认为我们比实际更聪明。递归是一种非常重 要的思想，但绝非高深莫测，而且它也不只是一项编程技术\n",
    "You may have heard of recursion, and in all likelihood think of it as a rather subtle programming technique. That’s a charming urban legend spread by computer scientists to make people think that we are smarter than we really are. Recursion is a very important idea, but it’s not so subtle, and it is more than a programming technique.\n",

    "“分治策略”是一种非常古老的思想。裘力斯·凯撒实行了罗马人所称的“分而治之”（ divideet impera），英国人也通过这种方式出色地控制了印度次大陆。本杰明·富兰克林非常熟悉英国人的这套玩弄权术的把戏，这使得他在签署美国《独立宣言》时说出了那句著名的话：“我们必须团结一致，否则就必定会被分别绞死。\n",
    "Divide-and-conquer is a very old idea. Julius Caesar practiced what the Romans referred to as divide et impera (divide and rule). The British practiced it brilliantly to control the Indian subcontinent. Benjamin Franklin was well aware of the British expertise in using this technique, prompting him to say at the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, “We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.”\n",
